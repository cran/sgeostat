<H2>Geostatistics for S+: Introduction</H2>

<p>The modeling tools described in this document are chiefly concerned
with the prediction, with known confidence, of a spatial stochastic
process, {<b><em>Z</em></b>(<b><em>s</em></b>): <b><em>s</em></b> (is
in) <EM>D</EM>}, at an arbitrary location, <b><em>s</em></b>0, from
data, {z(<b><em>s</em></b>1),...,z(<b><em>s</em></b>n)}. This is done
by characterizing the spatial dependence of the process from the data
and using a model of the dependence to construct a predictor that
minimizes the mean squared prediction error. The spatial dependence is
characterized through the variogram:

<p>The variogram is the variance of the difference of the random
process at two locations <b><em>s</em></b>i and
<b><em>s</em></b>j. Under the assumption of intrinsic stationarity,
this variance is expressed as a function only of the distance (and
direction) between the two locations. This dependence is typically
analyzed empirically by looking at pairs of points at which samples
have been collected. This pairwise analysis of sample points is used
in exploratory analysis, parametric variogram model fitting, and
spatial prediction, and forms the basis of the modeling tools in the
framework.

<p>The framework described in this document consists of exploratory
spatial data analysis, variogram modeling and spatial prediction
(kriging). The exploratory techniques include many of those described
in section 2.2 of Cressie (1993), including lagged scatter plots,
variogram cloud scatter plots and variogram cloud box plots. Where
appropriate, interactive querying of these plots is allowed.

<p>The discussion of the framework is illustrated using a data set
representing precipita tion stations in Iowa. The data set was derived
from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data sets, and
contains the location and the total precipitation in the year 1986 for
159 sites in Iowa and 2 sites in Minnesota. The location information
is derived from the Station Historical File (TD9767). The
precipitation amounts are derived from the NOAA Surface/Land Daily
Cooperative Summary of the Day File (TD3200). The TD3200 file contains
observations from sites operated by NOAA, as well as cooperative sites
operated under agreement with NOAA. The total precipitation for each
site was determined by summing the daily values observed at each site
during the year 1986. The stations are shown in Figure 22.
