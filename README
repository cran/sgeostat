Differences to the original distribution:

+ I added the functions fit.gaussian() and fit.spherical() similiar to 
  fit.exponential(). 

+ fit.variogram() is a call wrapper for the different variogram fitting 
  procedures.

+ which.na() included for R <-> S compatibility.

+ plot.point() changed: legend.pos parameter added.

+ The function variogram() (for variogram estimation) has been renamed to
  est.variogram() to avoid name conflicts (in the html help system) with the 
  variogram() function from library(spatial) (in Venables/Ripley).

+ Because of the lack of a persp() plot function in R, I changed calls to it 
  (in fit.trend()) to contour().

+ I added a dataset "maas" which originally belongs to "gstat", a geostatistics 
  package from E.J Pebesma (E.J.Pebesma@frw.uva.nl) available at

          http://www.frw.uva.nl/~pebesma/gstat/

  with measurements of zinc as a groundwater quality variable. Details can be 
  found at the URL above, e.g. a GIF-picture (zn_map.gif) with coordinates (it
  is also included here). 

  The dataset "maas.bank" contains coordinates of the maas bank, shown in 
  zn_map.gif. I produced these coordinates by "digitizing" this GIF picture in 
  a rather simple way: I created a drawing with tgif overlaying the imported 
  gif, exported this drawing in a postscript file and scaled the resulting 
  postscript coordinates according to the border of the picture. So the quality
  is rather poor. The files maas.dig and digi.R are related to this procedure.

+ The help pages stem from the original HTML help at

         http://www.gis.iastate.edu/SGeoStat/homepage.html

Some notes regarding the license:

This package is under GPL version 2 or newer.

The Original was public available from 1995 to 2006 (according to the records at
http://web.archive.org) at:

    http://www.gis.iastate.edu/SGeoStat/homepage.html

and seems to have vanished due to website restructuring.

In earlier versions (before 1.0-26) this archive contained a  subdirectory 
www-SGeoStat/ which contained a mirror of that site, also available at
http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.gis.iastate.edu/SGeoStat/homepage.html.
If you are interested in this please grab an older source package from the CRAN 
archives.

The original was written by S. Majure and intended for use wit S-Plus.

The original version contains no Copyright statements and no details about
redistributability, neither in the code nor on the web pages. Due to the fact
of the (former) public availability, together with the obvious intention of the 
original author that users should download and use this software (Downloading and 
Installation instructions) it can be assumed that the code is under public
domain and therefore can be relicensed under GPL.

So starting with version 1.0-25 this package is under GPL version 2 or newer.

Small parts have been added to the original code and are also licensed under 
GPL version 2 or newer, for details see README file.
